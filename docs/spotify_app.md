# Setup the Spotify plugin

In order to use the Spotify plugin you will need a Spotify Premium account.

You will also need to set up a Spotify app in the developer portal.

Instructions to do so are [here](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/tutorials/getting-started).

Once you have set that up you will need to add your Client ID, Client Secret, and Redirect URI in the .env file.

```python
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID = ''
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET = ''
SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI = ''

```
