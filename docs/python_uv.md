# Installation of Python and UV

## Installing Python

You will need python 3.12 or greater. You can download it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

>  I prefer to add python to my file path (add python to file path), to do that you will want to check the little box in the beginning of the installer

## Installing UV

The easiest was to install UV if you have python already installed is to install it globally by running `pip install uv`

UV will then be universally available to you on that machine.
